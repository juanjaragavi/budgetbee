content(personal-finance): add TOFU article on combining finances for couples

- New post: `yours-mine-or-ours-how-to-strategically-combine-finances-after-marriage-or-moving-in.mdx`
  - Category: personal-finance
  - SEO-focused title and intro using main keyword “personal finance”
  - Clear sections: models (joint, hybrid, separate), setup systems, protections, shared goals
  - ≥3 internal links to existing BudgetBee guides (50/30/20 rule, emergency fund, budgeting methods, paycheck, etc.)
  - Uses <AdZone id="us_budgetbeepro_4" /> per conventions
  - Valid ISO date and frontmatter; passes `pnpm check`

fix(pages): harden [regular].astro to avoid undefined `.data` during prerender

- Add runtime fallback to resolve page via `Astro.params.regular` when `Astro.props.page` is missing
- Redirect to /404 if not found instead of throwing
- Loosen local typing to avoid structural type mismatch from content entries

Build: Verified `pnpm check` passes with 0 errors.
