fix(security): update Netlify headers to allow ad iframes while maintaining CSP protection

- remove X-Frame-Options: DENY header (too restrictive for ad serving)
- add Content-Security-Policy with frame-ancestors directive
- whitelist ad domains: *.google.com, *.doubleclick.net, *.adzep.io, *.omeda.com
- maintain other security headers (X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, HSTS)
- create comprehensive documentation (CSP_FRAME_OPTIONS_FIX.md)
- explain report-only CSP violations from Google ad frames

This fix resolves console CSP errors on credit card recommender pages (p1, p2, p3)
while maintaining security by only allowing whitelisted ad networks to embed content.
More granular control than X-Frame-Options using modern CSP frame-ancestors directive.
