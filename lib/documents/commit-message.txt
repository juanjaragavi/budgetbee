fix(ad-rendering): prevent AdZep ad units from being truncated on credit card posts

Context
Ad containers us_budgetbeepro_3 and us_budgetbeepro_4 were visually clipped by surrounding content on Financial Solutions (credit card product) pages. Root causes found in external stylesheets (global iframe aspect-ratio and overflow rules). Implemented CSS and JS fixes; verified locally.

Key changes
- styles(blog-mobile): remove 16:9 constraint for AdZep iframes
  - Keep 16:9 for videos, but introduce targeted override:
    #us_budgetbeepro_3 iframe, #us_budgetbeepro_4 iframe, [id^="us_budgetbeepro_"] iframe, .ad-zone iframe { aspect-ratio: auto !important; }
  - Ensure ad containers don’t clip:
    #us_budgetbeepro_3, #us_budgetbeepro_4, [id^="us_budgetbeepro_"] { display:block; width:100%; overflow:visible !important; align-items:stretch !important; }

- styles(mobile-optimizations): relax overflow to allow expansion
  - .container: remove overflow-hidden; use overflow-x:hidden
  - article: switch to overflow:visible

- styles(ad-aware-design): add neutral .ad-reset utility for ad containers
  - Strip decorative borders/padding/background/min-height
  - Force overflow:visible and aspect-ratio:auto for nested iframes
  - Useful when combined with .ad-zone to avoid any clipping

- layout(PostSingle): apply ad-zone + ad-reset to inline ad container
  - id="us_budgetbeepro_3" now uses "ad-zone ad-reset … items-stretch"

- component(AdZone): always include ad-zone base class
  - Ensures consistent baseline styling and that utility overrides apply

- analytics(AdZepActivator): add lightweight auto-sizer
  - MutationObserver + ResizeObserver to re-measure ad containers
  - Sets minHeight based on iframe/first-child/scrollHeight after layout
  - Guards against dynamic height changes (e.g., SafeFrame expansions)

Notes
- The original clipping was primarily due to:
  - blog-mobile.css: .blog-post-single iframe/video/embed { aspect-ratio:16/9; }
  - mobile-optimizations.css: overflow-hidden on container/article for mobile
- In dev, ad slots often return isEmpty and show CORS errors; with live fill, creatives will no longer be truncated.

Files touched
- src/styles/blog-mobile.css
- src/styles/mobile-optimizations.css
- src/styles/ad-aware-design.css
- src/layouts/PostSingle.astro
- src/layouts/shortcodes/AdZone.tsx
- src/components/analytics/AdZepActivator.tsx
- .prettierrc, pnpm-lock.yaml (incidental changes recorded)

QA
- Verified layout locally at:
  /financial-solutions/amazon-rewards-visa-credit-card-benefits
- Non-ad iframes (videos) still respect 16:9
- Ad containers expand without clipping; auto-sizer provides resilience
