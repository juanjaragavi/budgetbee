fix(ads): post-top ad reliability + module script MIME fix

Context
- Post-top ad under title was intermittently empty on article loads/transitions.
- Console showed module script MIME errors when loading local TS/JS via /src paths.

Changes
- src/layouts/Base.astro
	- Bundle local modules via Vite using `?url` and load with `<script type="module" src={...}>`:
		- ad-manager.js, adzep-page-load-bridge.ts, article-loading-and-ad-init.ts
- src/lib/article-loading-and-ad-init.ts
	- Add `retryActivateIfEmpty` to force re-activation up to 3 times if `#us_budgetbeepro_3`/`_4` are still empty shortly after first activation.

Outcome
- Eliminates MIME errors and ensures our bootstrap/bridge run in prod.
- Improves reliability of the post-top ad unit after initial load and SPA transitions.
fix(scripts): bundle article/gam bridge scripts via ?url so prod serves JS with correct MIME

Context
Production was still attempting to load /src/lib/article-loading-and-ad-init.ts directly, causing “module script MIME type text/html” errors and preventing the post-top AdZep unit from initializing reliably.

Changes
- src/layouts/Base.astro
	- Import local modules as URLs with Vite’s `?url` and reference them via `<script type="module" src={...}>`:
		- ad-manager.js
		- adzep-page-load-bridge.ts
		- article-loading-and-ad-init.ts (article-only)

Outcome
- Ensures built JS files are served with the correct content-type and hashed URLs in production
- Removes MIME errors and allows AdZep init to run on initial loads and SPA transitions

fix(ads/bootstrap): resolve module script MIME error by bundling /src imports via inline module scripts

Context
Console showed: "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'text/html'." This happens when referencing /src/*.ts|js via <script src> in some prod/host contexts (serving HTML fallback). We now import inline so Vite bundles them into the page and serves with correct MIME.

Changes
- src/layouts/Base.astro
	- Switch from <script type="module" src="/src/..."> to inline module imports for:
		- /src/lib/ad-manager.js
		- /src/lib/adzep-page-load-bridge.ts
		- /src/lib/article-loading-and-ad-init.ts (article-only)

Outcome
- Eliminates MIME-type load error for module scripts
- Ensures AdZep activators load on first article and on SPA transitions

fix(ads): ensure AdZep activates on initial blog post load; remove early-return and document hotfix

Context
Direct loads of article pages sometimes missed `window.AdZepActivateAds()` because the article bootstrap exited early when ad slots weren’t immediately present. This caused no activation until a subsequent SPA transition.

Changes
- src/lib/article-loading-and-ad-init.ts
	- Remove premature `pageHasAdUnits()` gate so the scheduler always installs and retries while DOM settles
	- Keep safety: hide overlay quickly if no units; rely on adZepUtils idempotency

- lib/documents/ADZEP_ACTIVATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md
	- Add “Hotfix: Initial Blog Post Load Activation (Sep 10, 2025)” section with rationale and verification steps

- CHANGELOG.md
	- Record fix: AdZep not triggering on direct blog/article loads due to early-return; verified on Amazon Rewards Visa article

Verification
- Dev server pages return 200 for recommender and target article
- Post markup contains ad zones (#us_budgetbeepro_3 and #us_budgetbeepro_4)
- Activation logs appear on first article load; SPA transitions continue to activate via the bridge
