style(quiz): apply code formatting to navigation guard implementation

Applied Prettier formatting to quiz navigation guard files for consistency.
This commit includes whitespace cleanup and code style improvements across
the navigation guard implementation without any functional changes.

Files formatted:
- lib/documents/QUIZ_NAVIGATION_GUARD.md (markdown formatting)
- lib/documents/commit-message.txt (whitespace cleanup)
- src/components/quiz/QuizAccessGuard.tsx (prettier formatting)
- src/lib/recommenderPageGuard.ts (prettier formatting)
- src/lib/utils/quizNavigationGuard.ts (prettier formatting)
- src/pages/credit-card-recommender-p1.astro (prettier formatting)
- src/pages/credit-card-recommender-p2.astro (prettier formatting)
- src/pages/credit-card-recommender-p3.astro (prettier formatting)
- src/pages/quiz.astro (prettier formatting)

Changes:
- Fixed markdown list spacing and blank lines around headings
- Standardized trailing commas in TypeScript/JavaScript
- Normalized whitespace and indentation
- Applied consistent code block formatting

No functional changes - code behavior remains identical.

- Appends preserved params to redirect URLs

SessionStorage Flags:
- budgetbee_recommender_accessed: Boolean flag indicating recommender visit
- budgetbee_quiz_completed: ISO timestamp of quiz completion
- Isolated per browser tab/window (desired behavior)
- Cleared on browser close (allows fresh quiz in new session)

Files Created:
- src/lib/utils/quizNavigationGuard.ts (core utility, 200+ lines)
- src/components/quiz/QuizAccessGuard.tsx (React guard component)
- src/lib/recommenderPageGuard.ts (alternative implementation)
- lib/documents/QUIZ_NAVIGATION_GUARD.md (comprehensive documentation)

Files Modified:
- src/pages/quiz.astro (added QuizAccessGuard component)
- src/pages/credit-card-recommender-p1.astro (added guard script)
- src/pages/credit-card-recommender-p2.astro (added guard script)
- src/pages/credit-card-recommender-p3.astro (added guard script)

User Flow:
1. User visits /quiz (optionally with UTM params)
2. Completes quiz → redirected to external recommender link
3. User navigates to BudgetBee recommender pages
4. Guard installed, recommender_accessed flag set in sessionStorage
5. Any attempt to access /quiz → blocked and redirected to recommender
6. UTM parameters preserved through all redirects

Edge Cases Handled:
- Direct URL access to /quiz after completion: Blocked via guardQuizAccess()
- Browser refresh on recommender page: Guard persists via sessionStorage
- Back button navigation: Blocked via popstate event listener
- Astro view transitions: Blocked via astro:before-preparation listener
- New tab/window: sessionStorage isolated (allows separate flows)
- Browser close/reopen: sessionStorage cleared (fresh session)

Testing Checklist:
✅ Complete quiz and verify redirect
✅ Press back button → verify blocked from quiz
✅ Type /quiz in URL bar → verify redirect to recommender
✅ Refresh recommender page → verify guard persists
✅ Test with UTM parameters → verify preservation
✅ Check browser console for [QuizGuard] log messages
✅ Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
✅ Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

Browser Console Messages:
[QuizGuard] Recommender page accessed, quiz navigation blocked
[QuizGuard] History guard installed on recommender page
[QuizGuard] Quiz access blocked - redirecting to recommender
[QuizGuard] Back navigation to quiz blocked

Impact:
✅ Quiz re-entry completely blocked after recommender access
✅ UTM parameter integrity maintained across all navigation attempts
✅ Analytics data accuracy preserved
✅ Duplicate form submissions prevented
✅ User flow integrity maintained
✅ Zero performance impact (client-side only)
✅ Cross-browser compatible
✅ Mobile-friendly

Performance & Security:
- Zero network requests (all client-side logic)
- sessionStorage: Fast, synchronous, isolated per tab
- No sensitive data stored
- No external dependencies
- Compatible with all modern browsers
- Works with Astro SSR and view transitions
