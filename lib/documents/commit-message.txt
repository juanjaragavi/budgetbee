feat(ads): implement Autozep ad units for Financial Solutions blog posts

Integrated Autozep ad units mob_3 and mob_4 into Financial Solutions blog posts with proper text alignment preservation.

## Implementation Details

### Ad Unit Placement
- **us_budgetbeepro_com_mob_3**: Positioned after blog post title for early content monetization
- **us_budgetbeepro_com_mob_4**: Positioned at bottom of blog post content for completion engagement
- **Conditional rendering**: Only displays on Financial Solutions category posts

### Text Alignment Fix
- **Root issue**: Ad unit flex properties were causing blog content to center-align
- **Solution**: Added CSS isolation and explicit left-alignment rules
- **Scope**: Applied comprehensive text alignment preservation across all content elements

### Technical Implementation

#### PostSingle.astro Changes
- Added conditional Autozep ad units for `isFinancialSolution` posts
- Implemented CSS isolation with `isolation: isolate` on ad containers
- Added scoped styling to enforce left text alignment for blog content
- Applied inline styles with `!important` declarations for alignment consistency

#### CSS Enhancements (ad-aware-design.css)
- Added `.ad-zone-top` and `.ad-zone-bottom` positioning classes
- Implemented comprehensive left-alignment rules for all content elements (p, h1-h6, ul, ol, li)
- Added CSS isolation rules to prevent ad zone styles from affecting content
- Included responsive breakpoints for optimal mobile and desktop display

### Design Consistency
- **Ad units**: Properly centered within their containers using existing ad-zone styling
- **Blog content**: Maintained left-alignment for all text elements as intended
- **Responsive**: Consistent behavior across mobile and desktop viewports
- **Category-specific**: Only affects Financial Solutions posts, other categories unaffected

### Quality Assurance
- Tested across multiple Financial Solutions blog posts
- Verified text alignment preservation
- Confirmed ad unit visibility and proper positioning
- Ensured no impact on other blog post categories

The implementation successfully monetizes Financial Solutions content while preserving the intended reading experience and design consistency.
