feat(financial-solutions, ads): move AdZep unit into MDX via AdZone; normalize CTAs/internal links; enforce link styling

- Add AdZone shortcode component:
  - src/layouts/shortcodes/AdZone.tsx renders a plain ad container div (default id="us_budgetbeepro_4") for AdZep to target.
  - Auto-imported via astro.config.mjs so <AdZone /> is usable directly in MDX.

- Stop layout-level injection/repositioning of unit 4:
  - Removed hardcoded us_budgetbeepro_4 container and DOM reposition script from src/layouts/PostSingle.astro.
  - Prevents the ad from rendering outside the content area.

- Enforce visible link styling for Financial Solutions:
  - In PostSingle.astro, style all in-content anchors (including nested strong/em) as brand yellow and underlined to match design and improve visibility.

- Content optimization across all 15 product pairs (30 MDX files):
  - Inject <AdZone id="us_budgetbeepro_4" /> before the final section (last h3) within each Benefits and Requirements article (never after CTA).
  - Benefits pages: ensure exactly one CTA labeled "See Requirements" linking to the corresponding -requirements page.
  - Requirements pages: ensure exactly one external CTA labeled "Apply on Official Site"; add varied inline internal links (2 product benefits + 1 personal finance post) BEFORE the CTA; ensure no links after CTA.
  - All work performed by scripts/optimize-financial-solutions.mjs and executed to update all files.

- Misc:
  - astro.config.mjs: added "@/shortcodes/AdZone" to AutoImport.
  - Cleaned legacy link formatting issues in requirements MDX (duplicate brackets, etc.).

Why:
- Ensures the AdZep unit renders inside the article content immediately before the final heading/paragraph and before CTAs, matching product/SEO requirements and Google policies.
- Improves on-site engagement and consistency by standardizing interlinking and CTA behavior.
- Makes link styling consistent and brand-aligned.

Files touched (high level):
- New: src/layouts/shortcodes/AdZone.tsx, scripts/optimize-financial-solutions.mjs
- Updated: astro.config.mjs, src/layouts/PostSingle.astro, and all files in src/content/financial-solutions/*.mdx
