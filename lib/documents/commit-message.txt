fix(react): resolve "Invalid hook call" on article pages via client-only island

- refactor(PostSingle.astro): render AIContentDisclaimerStatic with client:only="react" to prevent SSR-time hook execution that triggered React's "Invalid hook call"
- chore(analytics): gate AdZepActivator behind import.meta.env.PROD in AnalyticsWrapper; keep UtmPersister/UtmMonitor and AdZepDebugger only in development
- chore(layout): gate external ad stack in Base.astro to production only
  - budgetbee ad-manager module & GPT script wrapped in isProduction checks
  - AdZep external loader script also gated to production
  => reduces CORS/attestation noise and missing-div warnings during local dev
- fix(content): correct collection index lookup on Financial Solutions page
  - getEntry("financial-solutions", "-index") (remove .md) to match content entry ids
- dev: verified no "Invalid hook call" in server logs; pages render clean; dev console free from ad/GAM noise (expected AdZep inactive in dev); ads continue to run in preview/production

Files changed (highlights):
- src/layouts/PostSingle.astro
- src/components/analytics/AnalyticsWrapper.tsx
- src/layouts/Base.astro
- src/pages/financial-solutions/index.astro

No breaking changes. Ads & activations remain enabled in preview/production builds.

Refs: fix React hooks usage with Astro islands; tidy developer experience in local environment.
