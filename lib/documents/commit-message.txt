feat(api,brevo): migrate quiz submission to Brevo & add dual list targeting

## Summary

Complete migration of the marketing contact management system from SendGrid to Brevo for the quiz submission API endpoint, plus update to target two Brevo lists (7 & 5) and addition of historical quiz submissions export CSV for analytics.

## Key Changes

### API Integration Migration
- Replace SendGrid API calls with Brevo API integration in `quiz-submission.ts`
- Update environment variable usage from SENDGRID_API_KEY to BREVO_API_KEY
- Change API endpoint from SendGrid marketing contacts to Brevo contacts API
- Update HTTP method from PUT to POST and adjust response status handling (201/204)

### Payload Structure Updates
- Implement dynamic ext_id generation with timestamp format: `budgetbee-{timestamp}`
- Add required COUNTRIES attribute set to "United States"
- Update contact attributes structure (FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, COUNTRIES)
- Configure list management with listIds array instead of list_ids
- Expand list coverage from single list (7) to dual lists `[7, 5]` for segmentation test
- Enable updateEnabled flag for contact updates

### Testing Infrastructure
- Add comprehensive test script for Brevo integration validation
- Create payload validation tools for ext_id format verification
- Include enhanced testing with mock server capabilities
- Test successful integration with specified test data (Juan Miguel / juan.jaramillo@topnetworks.co)

## Files Modified

- `src/pages/api/quiz-submission.ts` - Core API endpoint migration from SendGrid to Brevo and dual list IDs
- `lib/documents/brevo-payload.js` - Updated API key configuration and list ID setup (if present)

## Files Added

- `scripts/test-brevo-integration.js` - Test script for validating Brevo integration
- `scripts/test-brevo-payload-validation.js` - Enhanced payload inspection tooling
- `scripts/verify-ext-id-format.js` - ext_id format validation utility
- `lib/documents/registro-de-usuarios-quizes-budgetbee.csv` - Historical + current quiz submissions export (analytics & retention modeling)

## Testing

- ✅ Integration test passed with Brevo API
- ✅ Google Sheets integration maintains compatibility
- ✅ ext_id format validation confirms correct timestamp generation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
- ✅ Payload structure meets Brevo API requirements

## Breaking Changes

- SendGrid integration completely removed and replaced with Brevo
- Environment variable SENDGRID_API_KEY and SENDGRID_LIST_ID no longer used
- Response structure updated to reflect 'brevo' instead of 'sendGrid' in integrations object

## Notes

- Large CSV inclusion may increase repo size; consider future archival or moving to data storage bucket if it grows further.
