fix(ads): ensure AdZep activates on initial blog post load; remove early-return and document hotfix

Context
Direct loads of article pages sometimes missed `window.AdZepActivateAds()` because the article bootstrap exited early when ad slots weren’t immediately present. This caused no activation until a subsequent SPA transition.

Changes
- src/lib/article-loading-and-ad-init.ts
	- Remove premature `pageHasAdUnits()` gate so the scheduler always installs and retries while DOM settles
	- Keep safety: hide overlay quickly if no units; rely on adZepUtils idempotency

- lib/documents/ADZEP_ACTIVATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md
	- Add “Hotfix: Initial Blog Post Load Activation (Sep 10, 2025)” section with rationale and verification steps

- CHANGELOG.md
	- Record fix: AdZep not triggering on direct blog/article loads due to early-return; verified on Amazon Rewards Visa article

Verification
- Dev server pages return 200 for recommender and target article
- Post markup contains ad zones (#us_budgetbeepro_3 and #us_budgetbeepro_4)
- Activation logs appear on first article load; SPA transitions continue to activate via the bridge
