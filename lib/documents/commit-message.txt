feat: Implement two-phase internal linking strategy

This commit introduces a new internal linking strategy to enhance SEO:

- **Phase 1: Interlinked Product Pages:** Added "Explore Other Financial Solutions" sections to all `benefits.mdx` files in `src/content/financial-solutions`, recommending related credit card products.
- **Phase 2: Linked Articles to Products:** Added "Credit Cards to Support Your..." sections to the conclusion of all informational articles in `src/content/personal-finance`, linking to relevant financial product pages.

This improves the site's internal linking structure, positioning financial products as solutions within informational content.
