feat: Implement environment variable for quiz bypass

Refactors the quiz form bypass logic to be controlled by the `BYPASS_QUIZ_COOKIE_VALIDATION` environment variable.

- Disables the previous cookie-only validation.
- Adds `BYPASS_QUIZ_COOKIE_VALIDATION` to control the feature.
- Creates `src/env.d.ts` for environment variable type safety.
