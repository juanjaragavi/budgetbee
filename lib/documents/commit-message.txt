feat: Enhanced Quiz Navigation Guard with Internal Redirect Flow and Comprehensive Testing

## Summary

Successfully enhanced the existing Quiz Navigation Guard system to provide seamless protection against backward navigation from Credit Card Recommender pages to the Quiz page, with complete UTM parameter preservation throughout the user journey.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Internal Redirect Flow (Critical Enhancement)
- **File**: `src/components/quiz/CreditCardForm.jsx`
- **Change**: Quiz now redirects to internal `/credit-card-recommender-p1` instead of external `linkly.link` URL
- **Impact**: Guard activates immediately after quiz completion, ensuring uninterrupted UTM tracking

### 2. Enhanced Navigation Protection
- **File**: `src/lib/utils/quizNavigationGuard.ts`
- **Added**: `maintainGuardState()` and `handleHashChange()` functions
- **New Event Listeners**: `beforeunload` and `hashchange` for comprehensive protection

### 3. Comprehensive Testing Suite
- **File**: `scripts/test-quiz-navigation-guard.js` (NEW)
- **Features**: 10 automated tests + manual testing utilities

### 4. Enhanced Documentation
- **Updated**: `lib/documents/QUIZ_NAVIGATION_GUARD.md`
- **New**: `lib/documents/QUIZ_NAVIGATION_GUARD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- **New**: `lib/documents/QUIZ_NAVIGATION_GUARD_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
