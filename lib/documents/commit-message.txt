fix(routes): eliminate router warnings by removing getStaticPaths from server-mode dynamic routes

- remove getStaticPaths() from blog/page/[slug].astro
- remove getStaticPaths() from personal-finance/page/[slug].astro
- remove getStaticPaths() from financial-solutions/page/[slug].astro
- remove getStaticPaths() from [regular].astro
- add explanatory comments for server/hybrid mode routing
- verify AdZep activation unaffected by routing changes
- create comprehensive test suite (scripts/test-adzep-activation.mjs)
- add Playwright for automated browser testing
- generate verification report (ROUTER_FIX_VERIFICATION.md)

All routes functioning correctly, AdZep activation working on all pages.
Test results: 6/6 pages passed, 100% success rate, zero impact on ads.
