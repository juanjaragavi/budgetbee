refactor: Clean up blog structure and update documentation
Ad-aware CSS refinements: stronger mobile/desktop separators, spacing, and alignment fixes

Summary
- Normalize linear-gradient and repeating-linear-gradient syntax for readability and consistency
- Increase ad-zone min-height to 300px and clarify visual separation between content and ad areas
- Strengthen mobile ad separator styling and add subtle background buffers
- Tighten selector spacing (combinators like + and >) to match project style and avoid PostCSS formatting diffs
- Maintain CTA prominence with z-index and spacing; no behavioral changes to layout

Files
- src/styles/ad-aware-design.css
	- Normalize gradient syntax; bump ad-zone min-height (280px -> 300px)
	- Improve mobile/print/reduced-motion blocks formatting; keep semantics identical
	- Normalize adjacent-sibling selector spacing (.ad-zone+* and *+.ad-zone)

- src/styles/blog-mobile.css
	- Normalize selector combinator spacing (img+h1, :not(pre)>code)
	- Keep smooth scrolling declaration while separating comment
	- Remove redundant h-auto utility from iframes to defer to aspect-ratio

Notes
- Visual changes limited to clearer ad/content boundaries and minor height tweak
- No breaking class renames; utility-first intent preserved
- Removed deprecated blog category and demo pages.
- Updated project rules, canonical URL validation, and blog generation prompts.
- Simplified blog routing by removing old category-based paths.
