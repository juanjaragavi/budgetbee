feat(ads): Add AdZep units to Personal Finance via MDX; align placement with Financial Solutions

Summary
- Migrated all Personal Finance articles to MDX and embedded ad unit divs to support AdZep placement identical to Financial Solutions content.
- Kept us_budgetbeepro_3 (top-of-article) rendering after H1 for Personal Finance in PostSingle.astro.
- Moved us_budgetbeepro_4 to be content-driven in Personal Finance by injecting <AdZone id="us_budgetbeepro_4" /> before the final in-article heading for each PF post.
- Removed layout-based placeholder/repositioning for ad4 to avoid duplication and ensure correct placement.

Details
- Converted 18 Personal Finance posts from .md to .mdx to allow JSX/shortcode usage:
  - Deleted .md files under src/content/personal-finance/*
  - Added equivalent .mdx files with MDX content
  - Injected <AdZone id="us_budgetbeepro_4" /> immediately before the last ##–###### heading found in each article. If no such heading exists, injected near the end of the document.
- PostSingle.astro:
  - Ensured Personal Finance category renders <div id="us_budgetbeepro_3"> after the H1 (consistent with Financial Solutions top placement).
  - Removed previous layout-based ad4 placeholder and JS reposition logic so ad4 only comes from the article content.
- Shortcodes:
  - Verified/adjusted src/layouts/shortcodes/AdZone.tsx to render a plain div with the provided id (default supported by auto-import).
- Tooling:
  - Added scripts/convert-personal-finance-to-mdx.mjs to programmatically convert and inject ad4 placement for PF content. This script preserves frontmatter and body while inserting the AdZone component at the correct position.

Why
- MDX enables consistent, explicit, content-level control over ad placement, matching Financial Solutions’ approach and ensuring us_budgetbeepro_4 appears before the last section heading as requested.
- Avoids brittle DOM-based repositioning and eliminates duplicate ad render under us_budgetbeepro_3.

Testing/Verification
- Verified locally on dev server: Personal Finance MDX pages now include the expected ad zone structure.
- AdZep logs show “empty” renders in dev (expected without live creatives); structural placement is correct.

Files changed (high-level)
- Added: scripts/convert-personal-finance-to-mdx.mjs
- Modified: src/layouts/PostSingle.astro
- Modified: src/layouts/shortcodes/AdZone.tsx
- Modified: CHANGELOG.md
- Modified: pnpm-lock.yaml
- Deleted: 18 .md files in src/content/personal-finance/
- Added: 18 .mdx files in src/content/personal-finance/ (with <AdZone id="us_budgetbeepro_4" /> injected)

Notes
- Base.astro AdZep activation remains unchanged (autozep script + AnalyticsWrapper). No impact to global activation path.
