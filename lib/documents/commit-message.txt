fix(layout): ensure GTM is applied to quiz page

Refactors `QuizLayout.astro` to use the main `Base.astro` layout.

This change ensures that all essential scripts and meta tags, including the Google Tag Manager (GTM) pixel, are consistently applied to the quiz page, resolving an issue where the GTM script was previously missing.
