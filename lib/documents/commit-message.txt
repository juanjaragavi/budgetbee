## Summary

Complete migration of the marketing contact management system from SendGrid to Brevo for the quiz submission API endpoint.

## Key Changes

### API Integration Migration

- Update environment variable usage from SENDGRID_API_KEY to BREVO_API_KEY
- Change API endpoint from SendGrid marketing contacts to Brevo contacts API
- Update HTTP method from PUT to POST and adjust response status handling (201/204)

### Payload Structure Updates
- Implement dynamic ext_id generation with timestamp format: `budgetbee-{timestamp}`
- Add required COUNTRIES attribute set to "United States"
- Update contact attributes structure (FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, COUNTRIES)
- Configure list management with listIds array instead of list_ids
- Enable updateEnabled flag for contact updates

### Testing Infrastructure
- Add comprehensive test script for Brevo integration validation
- Create payload validation tools for ext_id format verification
- Include enhanced testing with mock server capabilities
- Test successful integration with specified test data (Juan Miguel / juan.jaramillo@topnetworks.co)
