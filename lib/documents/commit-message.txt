feat: Migrate marketing-related components and custom scripts from TopFinanzas UK Blog to BudgetBee AstroJS project.

This commit migrates marketing-related components and custom scripts from the TopFinanzas UK Blog to the BudgetBee AstroJS project. This includes analyzing the TopFinanzas UK Blog source, identifying marketing integrations (Google Tag, third-party tools), and adapting/implementing complex components (e.g., UTM Persister) into BudgetBee AstroJS. Official documentation was used for guidance (e.g., Google Analytics, Ad Manager).

The following changes were made:
- Analyzed TopFinanzas UK Blog source for marketing integrations.
- Identified and adapted complex components like UTM Persister.
- Implemented Google Tag Manager integration.
- Ensured compatibility with AstroJS project structure.
- Verified functionality of migrated scripts and components.
