feat: Add blog structure analysis and AstroJS research documentation

This commit introduces a new documentation file `6-BLOG-STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS.md` under `.clinerules/`. This document provides a detailed analysis of the current blog structure within the BudgetBee project and summarizes key findings from AstroJS documentation regarding blog and article handling.

The analysis covers:
- Content location and format (`src/content/blog/`, Markdown/MDX)
- URL mapping (`/blog/[single]`)
- Categories and tags handling
- Metadata extraction from frontmatter
- Article generation and rendering process

The AstroJS research findings highlight:
- The use of Content Collections (`astro:content`) for type-safe content management.
- Built-in Markdown/MDX support.
- Dynamic routing with `getStaticPaths`.
- Frontmatter for metadata.
- `render()` function for content rendering.
- Importance of layouts for consistency.
- Support for pagination.
- CMS integration capabilities.

This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for understanding and further developing the blog system within BudgetBee.

Additionally, this commit includes a minor modification to `src/pages/blog/[single].astro` to ensure compatibility or minor improvements related to the blog structure.
