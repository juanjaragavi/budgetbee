refactor: rename deploy script to deploy-project for clarity

## Script Naming Improvement
- **package.json**: Renamed 'deploy' script to 'deploy-project' for better clarity and specificity
- **Consistency**: Improves script naming consistency and prevents potential conflicts with generic deploy commands
- **Documentation Alignment**: Ensures script names are descriptive and self-documenting

## Benefits
- **Clearer Intent**: The script name now clearly indicates it deploys the project specifically
- **Namespace Clarity**: Reduces ambiguity between different types of deployment scripts
- **Better Developer Experience**: More descriptive script names improve discoverability and understanding
