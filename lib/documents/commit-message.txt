feat(quiz): migrate to SendGrid & add brand/country enrichment

Summary:
- Replaced legacy ConvertKit quiz submission with SendGrid Marketing Contacts upsert (PUT /v3/marketing/contacts)
- Added validation (email format, required name + consent) and normalized name splitting
- Introduced hidden enrichment fields Brand=BudgetBee and Country=United States in `CreditCardForm.jsx`
- Extended API handler to accept brand/country and scaffold dynamic custom field mapping via env-driven field IDs
- Implemented safe defaults + sanitation for enrichment fields
- Prepared for future custom field IDs: SENDGRID_PREFERENCE_FIELD_ID, SENDGRID_INCOME_FIELD_ID, SENDGRID_CONSENT_FIELD_ID, SENDGRID_BRAND_FIELD_ID, SENDGRID_COUNTRY_FIELD_ID
- Updated CHANGELOG with migration and enrichment entries

Why:
Improves lead data quality and enables segmentation (e.g., Brand/Country filters) directly in SendGrid while deprecating ConvertKit dependency.
