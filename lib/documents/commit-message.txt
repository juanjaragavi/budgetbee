fix(mdx, ads): resolve AdZone undefined and React hook warnings by injecting explicit MDX import; keep component island-safe

- Optimizer enhancement:
  - scripts/optimize-financial-solutions.mjs now ensures every Financial Solutions MDX file contains:
      import AdZone from "@/shortcodes/AdZone";
    right after frontmatter (or at top if no frontmatter).
  - Prevents runtime "_missingMdxReference" and "Expected component 'AdZone' to be defined" errors.
  - Re-ran optimizer to update all 30 MDX files.

- Ad rendering:
  - AdZone remains a simple static React component (no hooks) and is safe to render server-side from MDX.
  - MDX now directly imports AdZone, so no reliance on auto-import for MDX compilation.

- PostSingle styles remain to enforce yellow + underline links for Financial Solutions pages.

Result:
- Eliminates Invalid Hook Call warnings that were triggered when MDX encountered an undefined component during render.
- Ad unit us_budgetbeepro_4 now renders reliably inside article content, before the final section and prior to the CTA.
