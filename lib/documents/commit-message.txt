feat: Add SPA ad lifecycle and direct CTA flows

## Summary

- Extend `BudgetBeeAdManager` to handle Astro SPA navigations with slot refreshes, context updates, and cleanup, and configure GPT to disable initial load.
- Refresh `Base.astro` initialization to issue slot refreshes on display and align with the updated ad manager defaults.
- Simplify `credit-card-recommender-p2` and `-p3` to present direct CTA buttons with optional requirement links and alternate recommendations.
- Document the GPT SPA workflow in `GOOGLE_ADS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` and log the related follow-up items in `.clinerules/3-TASKS.md`.
