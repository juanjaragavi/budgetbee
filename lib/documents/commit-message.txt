fix: Personal Finance page filtering and content categorization

## Key Fixes
- **Content Separation**: Fixed Personal Finance page to only show personal-finance collection posts, removing credit card content that was incorrectly appearing
- **Filter Simplification**: Removed non-functional "Financial Solutions" filter from Personal Finance page since all content is now Personal Finance specific
- **Data Structure**: Added proper article-card classes and data-categories attributes for future filtering needs
- **Pagination**: Replaced PaginatedPosts component with standalone Pagination component to maintain proper page navigation

## Content Organization
- Credit card posts now only appear in /financial-solutions where they belong
- Personal Finance page displays only relevant personal finance guides and tips
- Clear separation between financial education content and product recommendations

## Technical Improvements
- Removed unnecessary JavaScript filtering code since page now shows single category
- Streamlined component imports and dependencies
- Maintained proper pagination functionality

## User Experience
- Cleaner, more intuitive Personal Finance page without product recommendations
- Proper content categorization prevents user confusion
- Simplified navigation with appropriate content in each section
