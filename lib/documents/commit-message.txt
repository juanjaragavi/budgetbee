fix(ads): reposition second Autozep ad unit to correct location in Financial Solutions posts

Fixed positioning of us_budgetbeepro_com_mob_4 ad unit to appear before the last section title instead of at the bottom of blog posts.

## Problem Resolved

### Issue
- **Second ad unit** (`us_budgetbeepro_com_mob_4`) was appearing at the very bottom of blog posts
- **Required position**: Before the last section title (e.g., "Explore Other Financial Solutions")
- **Root cause**: Ad unit was placed after the entire `<Content />` component rendering

### Solution Implemented

#### Dynamic Repositioning System
- **JavaScript script**: Added client-side repositioning logic that runs after content loads
- **Smart targeting**: Identifies the last section heading using multiple keyword patterns
- **Fallback logic**: Uses last h3 heading if no specific pattern matches

#### Technical Implementation

##### PostSingle.astro Changes
- **Moved ad container**: Positioned outside content wrapper with unique ID (`mob-4-container`)
- **Added repositioning script**: DOM manipulation to move ad unit to correct position
- **Enhanced targeting logic**: Searches for conclusion-type section headings

##### CSS Enhancements (ad-aware-design.css)
- **New `.ad-zone-mid` class**: Specific styling for repositioned ad unit
- **Responsive updates**: Added responsive breakpoints for mid-positioned ad zones
- **Consistent spacing**: Maintains proper margins around repositioned ad

### Script Intelligence

The repositioning script searches for headings containing:
- `"explore"`, `"other"`, `"solutions"` (e.g., "Explore Other Financial Solutions")
- `"maximize"`, `"benefits"`, `"financial"` (conclusion sections)
- **Fallback**: Last h3 heading if no specific patterns found

### Quality Assurance

#### Testing Completed
- ✅ Amazon Rewards Visa Credit Card Benefits page
- ✅ Chase Freedom Unlimited Credit Card Benefits page
- ✅ Citi Double Cash Credit Card Benefits page
- ✅ Verified correct positioning before last sections
- ✅ Confirmed responsive behavior on mobile and desktop

#### Design Consistency Maintained
- **Ad styling**: Preserved existing ad-zone styling and appearance
- **Text alignment**: All previous left-alignment fixes remain intact
- **Responsive design**: Consistent behavior across all viewport sizes
- **Category targeting**: Only affects Financial Solutions posts as intended

### Result

The second ad unit now correctly appears in the middle of the content before conclusion sections, providing optimal ad placement for user engagement while maintaining the intended reading experience. The implementation works dynamically across different blog post structures and section titles.
