style(css): ensure responsive embeds and ad iframes rules in global styles

- blog-mobile: add/confirm 16:9 responsive embeds for iframe/video/embed with full width
- ad-aware-design: enforce .ad-reset iframe aspect-ratio:auto, block display, full width
- PostSingle/ad shortcodes: align with .ad-reset usage and blog-post-single container

Context: Request to integrate specific CSS rules into the main stylesheet via Tailwind layers. Project already uses layered CSS; updated/verified styles live in `src/styles/blog-mobile.css` and `src/styles/ad-aware-design.css`, imported by `src/styles/main.css`.

Verification: Dev check ensures iframes/videos are responsive in posts and ad iframes retain native height without clipping.
