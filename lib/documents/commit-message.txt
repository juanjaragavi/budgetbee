fix(adzep): wait for external script before invoking AdZepActivateAds to ensure proper ad display

- add waitForExternalAdZepScript() to explicitly wait for budgetbeepro.js to load
- increase MAX_DIRECT_ACTIVATION_ATTEMPTS from 5 to 20 (total 4 second wait)
- increase retry interval from 100ms to 200ms for better script loading tolerance
- increase initial delay from 100ms to 500ms before attempting activation
- convert scheduleAutoTrigger to async function to properly await script loading
- add comprehensive logging with emojis for better debugging visibility
- add page detection logging to verify financial-solutions pages are recognized

Impact:
- ensures window.AdZepActivateAds() is invoked AFTER external script is fully loaded
- eliminates "function unavailable" errors that prevented ad display
- fixes issue where users had to manually reload to see ads on product pages
- provides up to 5 seconds for external script to load (vs previous 500ms)
- adds detailed console logging to track script loading progress

Technical Details:
- waitForExternalAdZepScript() checks every 100ms for up to 5 seconds
- scheduleAutoTrigger now waits for script confirmation before proceeding
- Enhanced logging shows: script load time, retry attempts, page detection results
- Maintains all existing functionality including state reset and reloader mechanisms

Console Output Examples:
✅ Success: "[BlogPostAdZep] ✅ External AdZep script loaded (1234ms)"
⏳ Waiting: "[BlogPostAdZep] ⏳ Waiting for AdZepActivateAds... (initial-load, attempt 3/20)"
❌ Error: "[BlogPostAdZep] ❌ window.AdZepActivateAds() unavailable after 20 attempts"

Files Modified:
- src/lib/blogPostAdZepAutoTrigger.ts: enhanced script loading wait logic

Related Issues:
- Users reporting ads only display after manual page reload
- "window.AdZepActivateAds is not a function" errors in console
- Timing race condition between our activation code and external script loading
