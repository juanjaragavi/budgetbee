feat: implement comprehensive Google Ads Manager professional recommendations

## Mobile-First Ad-Aware Design Implementation

- **Enhanced CTA Positioning**: Primary CTAs positioned above all ad blocks with maximum z-index priority (z-index: 100)
- **Mobile Optimization**: 56px minimum touch-friendly button heights with enhanced spacing (3-4rem margins)
- **Visual Separators**: Prominent 4px horizontal separators with branded gradients and clear content/advertisement labeling
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Comprehensive GAM tag verification system preventing mob_1/mob_2 duplicate calls

## Core System Enhancements

### Ad-Aware CSS Design (`src/styles/ad-aware-design.css`)
- Mobile-first responsive design with enhanced CTA priority classes
- Clear visual separation between content and advertisement zones
- Enhanced spacing (80px click-buffers) to prevent accidental ad clicks
- Accessibility improvements with high contrast and reduced motion support

### GAM Tag Verification (`src/lib/ad-manager.js`)
- BudgetBeeAdManager class with comprehensive duplicate call detection
- Real-time performance monitoring and detailed error reporting
- Enhanced diagnostic tools (getAdDiagnostics, generateDuplicateReport)
- Backup initialization system with retry logic and failover

### Base Layout Integration (`src/layouts/Base.astro`)
- Enhanced GAM initialization with duplicate prevention
- Proper ad slot definitions with visual separation components
- Mobile-optimized ad zone structure with clear labeling
- Fallback ad display system for reliability

## Credit Card Recommender Pages Updated

- **Page 1**: Enhanced primary CTA positioning with ad-separator integration
- **Page 2**: Interactive reveal button with proper visual hierarchy
- **Page 3**: Scroll-triggered recommendation with enhanced button groups
- **All Pages**: Consistent ad-aware design implementation with click-buffer zones
