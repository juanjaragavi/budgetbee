quiz: deactivate cookie-based skip so info form always shows

- Remove BYPASS_QUIZ_COOKIE_VALIDATION redirect path and on-mount auto-redirect in CreditCardForm.jsx
- Stop marking users as `isRegisteredUser` from cookies; this previously auto-skipped Step 3 by auto-submitting after Step 2
- Retain safe prefill from cookie data (email/name) for UX, but it no longer influences control flow (no skip/auto-submit)
- Preserve normal submission flow and final redirect; cookies set post-submit remain for future prefill only

File(s) changed:
- src/components/quiz/CreditCardForm.jsx

Validation:
- Ran `pnpm check`: 0 errors, 0 warnings (only hints unrelated)
- Manual run-through confirms no cookie-based auto-skip or redirect; the info form is presented to all users

Notes:
- No other references found to `quizCompleted`, `userRegistered`, or `userData` impacting redirect/skip logic
