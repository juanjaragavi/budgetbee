feat: implement comprehensive SEO optimization with robots.txt and llms.txt

## SEO Preparation Implementation

- **Enhanced robots.txt**: Comprehensive SEO-optimized configuration with granular crawler controls
- **New llms.txt**: LLM-friendly content discovery following llmstxt.org specification
- **Documentation**: Complete implementation summary with validation results

## robots.txt Enhancements

### Access Controls & Bot Management
- Universal crawler rules with granular access controls for API endpoints and admin routes
- Google bot optimization with specific rules for Images, News, and general crawling
- Social media crawler support (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) for rich previews
- AI/LLM bot handling (ChatGPT, Claude, OpenAI, Google-Extended) with respectful crawl delays
- Bad bot protection blocking common scrapers (AhrefsBot, MJ12bot, DotBot, SemrushBot)

### Performance Optimization
- Crawl delay settings (1 second) for heavy crawlers to prevent server overload
- Multiple sitemap declarations for comprehensive content discovery
- Host directive specifying canonical domain (budgetbeepro.com)
- Essential file access explicitly allowed (CSS, JS, images, sitemaps)

## llms.txt Implementation

### Standards Compliance
- Full llmstxt.org specification compliance with H1 title and blockquote description
- Organized content sections for different audiences (developers, content creators, LLMs)
- Strategic link categorization: Core Documentation, Financial Content, Interactive Tools
- Optional section for secondary resources (deployment scripts, assets, components)

### Content Organization
- **Core Documentation**: README, License, Changelog for project understanding
- **Financial Content**: Blog, guides, product pages for domain expertise
- **Interactive Tools**: Quiz system and results for user engagement features
- **Technical Documentation**: Configuration files for development context
- **Content Structure**: Content management and site architecture files

## Implementation Benefits

### Modified Files
- `public/robots.txt` - Enhanced from basic to comprehensive SEO configuration (1,703 bytes, 94 lines)

### Removed Files
- `GOOGLE_ADS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Moved to proper documentation location

## Validation & Testing

### robots.txt Validation
- ✅ Syntax compliance verified with proper directive ordering
- ✅ User-agent declarations and crawl directives properly formatted
- ✅ Accessible via development server testing
- ✅ All essential files and sitemaps properly declared

### llms.txt Validation
- ✅ llmstxt.org specification compliance confirmed
- ✅ Required elements present (H1 title, blockquote description)
- ✅ Proper markdown formatting with organized section structure
- ✅ Strategic content organization for optimal LLM consumption

## Next Steps

1. **Google Search Console**: Submit updated robots.txt for search engine verification
2. **Sitemap Verification**: Ensure all declared sitemaps are accessible and current
3. **LLM Directory Registration**: Consider registering with llmstxt.site directory
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track crawler behavior changes in server logs
5. **Regular Maintenance**: Update files as site structure and content evolve

**File Locations**:
- `https://budgetbeepro.com/robots.txt`
- `https://budgetbeepro.com/llms.txt`
