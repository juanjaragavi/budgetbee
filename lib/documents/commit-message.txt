feat: US localization updates, robust date sorting, and dependency upgrades

Summary of changes:

Content & Prompt Localization:
- Converted blog post generation prompt to US English context (domain, sitemap, market references)
- Updated internal link guidance to use budgetbeepro.com and correct sitemap-index.xml
- Added Agent Authoring Directive sections to project rules and GitHub instructions for consistent content generation workflow

Sorting Logic Improvement:
- Rewrote sortByDate to be non-mutating, reverse chronological, and resilient to missing/invalid dates
- Ensures consistent newest-first ordering across homepage, blog, and category listings

Dependency Updates:
- Upgraded Astro core and related integrations (@astrojs/mdx, @astrojs/sitemap, markdown remark internals) to latest minor versions

Documentation / Configuration:
- Synced rules/instructions with US localisation directive and sitemap reference

Why:
- Guarantee correct ordering for newly published posts (supports 2 posts/week cadence)
- Eliminate potential side effects from in-place array mutation in previous sort implementation
- Align content generation pipeline with US market focus

Files affected (high-level):
- lib/documents/blog-post-generation-prompt.md (localization & sitemap URL)
- src/lib/utils/sortFunctions.ts (date sort refactor)
- .clinerules/1-RULES.md & .github/instructions/project-rules.instructions.md (authoring directive)
- package.json & pnpm-lock.yaml (dependency bumps)
- lib/documents/topfinanzas-us-topic-outline.csv (added US topic outline)

No breaking changes expected; build completed successfully.
