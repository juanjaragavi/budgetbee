fix: convert Financial Solutions button to proper navigation link in blog page

## Navigation Issue Resolution
- **src/pages/blog/index.astro**: Convert Financial Solutions button from `<button>` to `<a>` element
- **Add proper href**: Set href="/financial-solutions" for direct navigation
- **Consistency**: Ensure both category buttons (Personal Finance & Financial Solutions) behave consistently
- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper anchor tags for navigation instead of buttons

## Problem Fixed
- Financial Solutions button was previously implemented as a filter button instead of navigation link
- Users couldn't click to navigate to the financial solutions page
- Button was using `data-category` attribute instead of `href` for navigation

## Benefits
- **Improved UX**: Users can now successfully navigate to financial solutions page
- **Consistent Behavior**: Both category buttons now function as expected navigation links
- **Better Semantics**: Proper use of HTML elements for their intended purpose
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers and assistive technology can better understand navigation intent
