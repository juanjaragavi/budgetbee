# CSP Frame-Ancestors & X-Frame-Options Fix

## Date: 2025-06-XX

## Issue: Console CSP Error on Credit Card Recommender Pages

---

## Problem Description

### User Report

Console error detected on Credit Card Recommender landing pages (p1, p2, p3):

```
Framing 'https://www.google.com/' violates the following report-only Content Security Policy directive: "frame-ancestors 'self'"
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Two Issues Identified:**

1. **Google's Report-Only CSP** (Informational):
   - The error is coming FROM Google's ad iframe itself
   - It's a "report-only" violation, meaning it logs but doesn't block
   - Google is enforcing `frame-ancestors 'self'` on their own content
   - This is expected behavior and won't prevent ads from loading

2. **Netlify X-Frame-Options: DENY** (Blocking):
   - BudgetBee's `netlify.toml` contained `X-Frame-Options = "DENY"`
   - This header prevents ANY external site from embedding your pages in iframes
   - This could potentially block ad iframes from third-party ad networks
   - Conflicts with ad serving requirements

---

## Solution Implemented

### Configuration Change

**File**: `netlify.toml`

**Before:**

```toml
[headers.values]
X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
Referrer-Policy = "same-origin"
Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
```

**After:**

```toml
[headers.values]
# X-Frame-Options removed to allow ad iframes (AdZep, Google Ads)
# Using CSP frame-ancestors instead for more granular control
X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
Referrer-Policy = "same-origin"
Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
# Allow specific ad domains to frame content
Content-Security-Policy = "frame-ancestors 'self' https://*.google.com https://*.doubleclick.net https://*.adzep.io https://*.omeda.com"
```

### Changes Made

1. **Removed `X-Frame-Options: DENY`**
   - Was too restrictive for ad serving
   - Prevented legitimate ad iframes

2. **Added CSP `frame-ancestors` Directive**
   - More modern and granular than X-Frame-Options
   - Allows specific ad domains:
     - `'self'` - Own domain
     - `https://*.google.com` - Google Ads
     - `https://*.doubleclick.net` - DoubleClick (Google Ad Manager)
     - `https://*.adzep.io` - AdZep network
     - `https://*.omeda.com` - Omeda ad platform

3. **Maintained Other Security Headers**
   - X-XSS-Protection
   - Referrer-Policy
   - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

## Security Considerations

### What We Protected

✅ **Maintained Security**:

- Still prevents arbitrary sites from framing BudgetBee pages
- Only whitelisted ad networks can embed content
- CSP is more flexible than X-Frame-Options
- All other security headers remain active

### Trade-offs

⚠️ **Allowed Framing**:

- Ad networks can now embed specific content
- This is required for programmatic advertising
- Acceptable risk for revenue-generating pages

## Testing Plan

### Pages to Verify

1. `/credit-card-recommender-p1`
2. `/credit-card-recommender-p2`
3. `/credit-card-recommender-p3`

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Open Chrome DevTools Console
- [ ] Navigate to each credit card recommender page
- [ ] Verify CSP error no longer appears (or is report-only)
- [ ] Confirm ad containers load: `us_budgetbeepro_1`, `us_budgetbeepro_2`
- [ ] Check Network tab for successful ad requests
- [ ] Verify no 403/blocked responses from ad networks
- [ ] Test AdZep activation: `window.__adzepActivated` should be `true`

### Expected Outcome

- ✅ No blocking CSP errors
- ✅ Ads display successfully
- ✅ AdZep activation functions normally
- ℹ️ Google's report-only CSP message may still appear (this is normal)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes**:

   ```bash
   git add netlify.toml lib/documents/CSP_FRAME_OPTIONS_FIX.md
   git commit -m "fix: Update Netlify security headers to allow ad iframes while maintaining CSP protection"
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Wait for Netlify build to complete
   - Test on production URLs
   - Monitor Console for any new errors

## Notes

### About Report-Only CSP

The console message `violates the following report-only Content Security Policy` is **informational only**. When a CSP header is set to "report-only" mode, it logs violations but doesn't actually block the action. This is Google's way of testing CSP policies without breaking functionality.

### X-Frame-Options vs CSP

- **X-Frame-Options** is older and binary (DENY/SAMEORIGIN/ALLOW-FROM)
- **CSP frame-ancestors** is modern and allows wildcards/multiple domains
- CSP takes precedence when both are present
- We removed X-Frame-Options to avoid conflicts

### Ad Network Requirements

Programmatic advertising often requires the ability to:

1. Load content in iframes from ad servers
2. Communicate between ad frame and parent page
3. Track impressions and clicks across domains

Our CSP configuration balances security with ad functionality.
