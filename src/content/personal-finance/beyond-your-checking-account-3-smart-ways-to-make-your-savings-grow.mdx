If you're keeping all your money in a regular checking account, you're leaving money on the table—literally. While checking accounts are convenient for day-to-day expenses, they're not designed to help your money grow. The good news? You don't need to be a financial expert or have thousands of dollars to start making your savings work harder for you. There are simple, low-risk options that can help you earn more on the money you've already saved.

This guide will walk you through three smart, accessible ways to move beyond your checking account and start building real financial momentum. Whether you're saving for an emergency fund, a future goal, or just want to see your balance grow, these strategies can help you get there faster.

## Why Your Checking Account Isn't Enough

Most traditional checking accounts pay little to no interest—often as low as 0.01% APY (Annual Percentage Yield) or less. That means if you have $5,000 sitting in your checking account, you're earning about 50 cents per year. Meanwhile, inflation is steadily eroding your purchasing power.

The real issue isn't just what you're _not_ earning—it's what you're losing. With inflation averaging 2-3% annually (and sometimes much higher), your money is actually worth less each year if it's not growing at a similar rate.

> **The Bottom Line:** A checking account is essential for managing daily expenses, but it's not a growth tool. To build wealth and protect your purchasing power, you need to put at least some of your money into accounts designed to earn meaningful returns.

## 1. High-Yield Savings Accounts: Your Money's Best Friend

A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is exactly what it sounds like—a savings account that pays significantly more interest than traditional options. While a typical brick-and-mortar bank might offer 0.01% APY on savings, online banks and financial institutions like CIT Bank frequently offer rates between 3% and 5% or higher, depending on market conditions.

### How High-Yield Savings Accounts Work

HYSAs function just like regular savings accounts, but with better returns. Your money is FDIC-insured (protected up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution), remains liquid and accessible, and earns interest that compounds over time. The difference in earnings can be dramatic.

**Example:**

- **Traditional Savings Account (0.01% APY):** $10,000 earns about $1 per year
- **High-Yield Savings Account (4.5% APY):** $10,000 earns about $450 per year

That's a $449 difference for doing absolutely nothing except choosing a better account.

### Best Uses for High-Yield Savings

- **Emergency Fund:** Keep 3-6 months of expenses accessible while earning interest. Learn more about building your safety net in our guide on [What is an Emergency Fund and Why You Need One](/personal-finance/what-is-an-emergency-fund-and-why-you-need-one).
- **Short-Term Goals:** Save for a vacation, car down payment, or wedding within the next 1-3 years
- **General Savings Buffer:** Park money you don't need immediately but want to keep available

**CIT Bank's Platinum Savings Account** is a popular option offering competitive rates with no monthly fees and a low minimum opening deposit. You can explore their current offerings on the [official CIT Bank website](https://www.cit.com/cit-bank/platinum-savings/ps2025).

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Significantly higher interest than checking or traditional savings
- FDIC-insured safety
- Easy access to your money
- Low or no minimum balance requirements

**Cons:**

- Interest rates can fluctuate with market conditions
- May have monthly transaction limits (typically 6 withdrawals)
- Primarily available through online banks

## 2. Certificates of Deposit (CDs): Lock In Your Rate

If you have money you won't need for a specific period—say 6 months, 1 year, or 5 years—a Certificate of Deposit (CD) can offer even higher interest rates than a high-yield savings account. The trade-off is that your money is locked in for the agreed-upon term.

### How CDs Work

When you open a CD, you deposit a fixed amount of money for a predetermined length of time (the "term"). In exchange for committing your funds, the bank pays you a higher interest rate than you'd typically get on a savings account. At the end of the term (the "maturity date"), you receive your initial deposit plus all the interest earned.

**Example:**

- Deposit: $5,000
- Term: 12 months
- APY: 5.00%
- Total at maturity: $5,250

If you withdraw your money before the term ends, you'll typically pay an early withdrawal penalty, which can eat into your earnings.

### CD Laddering Strategy

One smart way to use CDs is called "CD laddering." Instead of putting all your money into one long-term CD, you divide it across multiple CDs with different maturity dates.

**Simple CD Ladder Example:**

- $2,000 in a 6-month CD
- $2,000 in a 12-month CD
- $2,000 in an 18-month CD
- $2,000 in a 24-month CD

As each CD matures, you can either access that money or reinvest it in a new CD. This approach gives you regular access to portions of your savings while still earning higher rates.

### Best Uses for CDs

- **Known Future Expenses:** Save for a planned purchase or expense with a specific timeline
- **Risk-Free Returns:** Grow money you won't need to touch for a guaranteed return
- **Part of a Diversified Savings Strategy:** Complement your emergency fund with longer-term savings

CIT Bank offers various CD options with competitive rates and flexible terms. Exploring different term lengths can help you find the right balance between return and accessibility.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Higher interest rates than most savings accounts
- Guaranteed returns (fixed rate for the term)
- FDIC-insured safety
- Forces disciplined saving

**Cons:**

- Money is locked up for the term
- Early withdrawal penalties apply
- Missing out on higher rates if market rates increase significantly

## 3. Money Market Accounts: The Best of Both Worlds

Money Market Accounts (MMAs) offer a middle ground between the high interest of a CD and the flexibility of a savings account. They typically pay competitive rates similar to high-yield savings accounts but come with additional features like check-writing privileges and debit card access.

### How Money Market Accounts Work

MMAs are deposit accounts that often require a higher minimum balance than regular savings accounts but compensate with better interest rates and more transaction flexibility. Like savings accounts and CDs, they're FDIC-insured up to the standard limits.

**Key Features:**

- Competitive interest rates (often tiered based on balance)
- Check-writing capabilities (usually limited to 6 per month)
- Debit card access at some institutions
- FDIC insurance protection

### Best Uses for Money Market Accounts

- **Emergency Fund Plus:** A step up from a basic emergency fund for those who want both growth and easy access
- **Bridge Account:** Hold money temporarily while deciding on longer-term investment options
- **Business Savings:** Ideal for freelancers or small business owners who need occasional access

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Competitive interest rates
- More flexible access than CDs
- Check-writing and debit card features
- FDIC-insured

**Cons:**

- Often require higher minimum balances
- Transaction limits still apply
- Interest rates may be slightly lower than top HYSAs
- Some accounts charge monthly fees if balance falls below minimum

## Choosing the Right Account(s) for Your Situation

You don't have to pick just one of these options—in fact, using a combination often works best. Here's a simple framework based on your goals:

### If You're Just Starting Out

#### **Start with a High-Yield Savings Account**

- Open an HYSA and begin building your emergency fund
- Aim for $500-$1,000 first, then work toward 3-6 months of expenses
- Once you have $1,000+ saved, consider diversifying

### If You Have a Specific Savings Goal with a Timeline

#### **Use a CD**

- Know you need $3,000 in 18 months for a trip? Open an 18-month CD
- Lock in a guaranteed rate and forget about it until maturity
- Avoid the temptation to spend by making the money less accessible

### If You Want Maximum Flexibility with Better Returns

#### **Choose a Money Market Account**

- Ideal if your income fluctuates and you might need occasional access
- Good for self-employed individuals or those with variable expenses
- Consider it after your emergency fund is established

### Real-World Example: A Balanced Approach

Sarah has $15,000 saved and wants to optimize it:

1. **$6,000 in an HYSA:** Emergency fund covering 3 months of expenses (easy access, earning 4.5%)
2. **$5,000 in a 12-month CD:** Saving for a down payment on a car next year (higher rate, locked in)
3. **$4,000 in a Money Market Account:** Extra buffer for irregular expenses like annual insurance premiums (flexible access with decent returns)

This strategy gives Sarah safety, growth, and flexibility without requiring her to become a financial expert.

## The Power of Starting Now

The difference between keeping your money in a checking account versus a high-yield savings account might seem small in the short term. But over months and years, that extra interest compounds into real money—money you can use for your goals, your security, and your future.

You don't need to be wealthy to make your savings grow. You just need to be smart about where you keep your money. By taking advantage of high-yield savings accounts, CDs, and money market accounts, you're making a simple but powerful decision: choosing to let your money work for you instead of just sitting idle.

The best time to start was yesterday. The second-best time is today.

### Credit Cards That Complement Your Savings Strategy

While building your savings, using the right credit card can help you earn rewards that boost your savings even faster—as long as you pay your balance in full each month.

- [**Citi Double Cash Card**](/financial-solutions/citi-double-cash-credit-card-benefits): Earn a simple 2% cashback on all purchases (1% when you buy, 1% as you pay). Direct that cashback straight into your high-yield savings.
- [**Chase Freedom Unlimited**](/financial-solutions/chase-freedom-unlimited-credit-card-benefits): Unlimited 1.5% cashback plus rotating bonus categories. Great for building rewards while building credit.
- [**Capital One Quicksilver Student**](/financial-solutions/capital-one-quicksilver-student-credit-card-benefits): Perfect for students starting their financial journey with unlimited 1.5% cashback and no annual fee.

Remember, credit cards are tools—not magic money. Use them responsibly, pay in full each month, and let the rewards enhance your savings plan rather than derailing it.

## Beyond Savings: Your Next Financial Steps

Once you've optimized where your savings live, you might start wondering about longer-term wealth building. That's where investing comes in. While savings accounts, CDs, and money market accounts are perfect for short-to-medium-term goals and emergency funds, investing is how you build wealth over decades.

If you're curious about the next step, our article on [The Difference Between Saving and Investing](/personal-finance/the-difference-between-saving-and-investing-which-should-you-do-first) explains when and how to transition from saver to investor.

Your financial journey is uniquely yours, but the fundamentals remain the same: save consistently, choose the right accounts, and always keep learning. By moving your money beyond a basic checking account and into smarter options like high-yield savings, CDs, and money market accounts, you're already ahead of the curve.

Start small if you need to. Start today. Your future self will thank you.
