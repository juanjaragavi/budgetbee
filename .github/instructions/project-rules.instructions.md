# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

- Update relevant documentation in `src/lib/documents/DOCUMENTATION.md` when modifying features
- Keep `README.md` in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in `/CHANGELOG.md`

## Project Awareness & Context

- Always read `2-PLANNING.md` at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- Check and update `3-TASKS.md` before starting a new task. If the task isnâ€™t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- Refer to `4-PUSH-AND-COMMIT.md` for commit and push guidelines.
- Review `5-BRANDING.md` for branding guidelines, including color palette, typography, and voice/tone.

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in `src/lib/documents/ADRs.md` for:

- Major dependency changes
- Architectural pattern changes
- New integration patterns

## Code Style & Patterns

- Generate API clients using OpenAPI Generator
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use repository pattern for data access

## Testing Standards

- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Tool Usage

A suite of MCP Server tools is available for your use. These tools should be employed as needed to perform various tasks.

### MCP Server Discovery

To identify available MCP Servers, utilize the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` to read the configuration file located at:
`/Users/macbookpro/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

This will provide you with a complete list of configured MCP servers and their capabilities.

### Astro Project Documentation

As this is an Astro project, before executing any task related to the structure of the project, you should use the `@upstash/context7-mcp@latest` MCP server tool to look for Astro documentation in <https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/>. This will ensure you have the most up-to-date information about Astro's patterns, conventions, and best practices.

### Effective Tool Selection

Analyze the capabilities of these tools to determine the most appropriate approach for your tasks.

## Push and Commit Guidelines

### Trigger

This procedure is initiated when the user issues the prompt "Push and commit our latest changes." following a successful development cycle.

#### Steps

1. **Initialize Commit Message File**:
   Clear the contents of the @/lib/documents/commit-message.txt file.

2. **Verify Codebase Status**:
   Query the current status of the codebase using your `git_status` MCP server with the following request body:

   ```json
   {
     "repo_path": "/Users/macbookpro/GitHub/budgetbee"
   }
   ```

3. **Formulate Commit Message**:
   Populate the @/lib/documents/commit-message.txt file with a message that accurately describes the latest modifications.

4. **Execute Workflow Script**:
   Run the `pnpm workflow` automation script using the command:

   ```bash
   bash ./scripts/git-workflow.sh
   ```
